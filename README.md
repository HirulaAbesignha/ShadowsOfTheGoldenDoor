## The Lost Key: Shadows of the Golden Door

## Story:
You are Alex, a curious adventurer who has ventured into the Ancient Labyrinth, a mysterious maze said to be filled with treasure and secrets. However, the maze is not just a place of riches – it's also a place of danger, with twisting corridors, hidden traps, and locked doors.

The only way out is through the Golden Door – but it is locked. To escape the maze, you must collect 3 Lost Keys hidden throughout the maze. Each key unlocks a new part of the labyrinth, and ultimately, the Golden Door will open, allowing you to escape.

As you navigate the maze, you will face:

Dangerous traps that can hurt you if you're not careful.
Locked doors that require keys to open.
Hidden secrets that will help you on your journey.
Will you find all the keys and escape the maze, or will you get lost forever?
