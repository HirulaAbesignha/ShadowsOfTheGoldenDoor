## **🌱 How to Contribute:**

### 1. **Fork the Repo**  
   Start by **forking** the repo (click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository). This allows you to make a personal copy of the project to work on.

### 2. **Check Open Issues**
   Before making any changes, **check the Issues tab** to see if there’s an open issue that you would like to work on. Issues are tasks that need to be addressed, such as fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving the game.

   - If there is an issue you want to tackle, leave a **comment** on the issue to **request to be assigned** to it. This helps prevent duplicate work and ensures that everyone is on the same page.

   - If there’s no existing issue that matches what you want to work on, feel free to **open a new issue** describing the problem or feature idea.

### 3. **Create a New Branch**  
   Once you're assigned to an issue (or have created a new one), **create a new branch** for your changes:
   
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-idea
```

Note: The above command should be run in the terminal within your local project folder. This command creates a new branch in your local Git repository.

### 4. Make Changes
Work on your changes, following the PEP-8 style guide (for Python), and ensure your code is well-documented. Remember, your changes should be related to the issue you're assigned to!

### 5. Test Your Work
Before creating a pull request (PR), test your changes thoroughly to ensure everything works as expected. This is crucial to avoid introducing errors into the main project. Here's what you should do:

Run the Game: After making your changes, test the game by running it:

```bash
python main.py
```

- This command should be run in your terminal, and it should launch the game window.

- If you encounter issues, you can use the terminal to see error logs, which can help with debugging.

- Provide Proof: If your change involves a visual or interactive feature, take a screenshot or screen recording showing your work in action. If the change involves bug fixes, include a before-and-after comparison or a log showing the error was fixed.

  - For how to take a screenshot on Windows, check out this guide.

  - For macOS, press Shift + Command + 4 to select a region of the screen to capture.

  - On Linux, use PrtScn or a screenshot tool like Flameshot.

- Log Errors (if any): If your changes involve error fixing, please also include the error messages (if applicable), so we know what was fixed.

- Submit Proof with Your PR: Once your changes are fully tested and confirmed to work, include the proof (screenshot, screen recording, etc.) in your PR description. This will help us review your contribution more effectively.

### 6. Commit Changes
Once your changes are complete and thoroughly tested, commit them using conventional commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new key mechanic"
```

- Commit messages should be concise and clear, explaining the what and why of your changes.

### 7. Push Your Changes
After committing your changes, push them back to your forked repo:

```bash
git push origin feature/my-awesome-idea
```

### 8. Open a Pull Request (PR)
Once your changes are pushed to your fork, you can open a Pull Request (PR) to submit them for review.

- In the PR description, link it to the issue you were assigned (e.g., "Fixes #12" for bug fixes, or "Closes #7" for features).

- Be sure to explain in your PR description what changes you made, why they are important, and attach proof (e.g., screenshots or screen recordings) showing your changes in action.

### 9. Wait for Review
After opening the PR, wait for review. We’ll review your changes and provide feedback. If everything looks good, we’ll merge it into the main repo.

- If any changes are needed, we’ll let you know, and you can make additional changes before it’s merged.

### 🏷️ Labels:
Look for issues tagged with:

- good first issue – Perfect for new contributors.

- help wanted – We need your help!

- enhancement – Help us make the game better.

- bug – Found a bug? Report it and help us fix it.

### 📑 What Are Issues?
In GitHub, issues are a way to track tasks, enhancements, bugs, or discussions related to the project. They help keep the project organized by breaking down the work into manageable pieces.

Here’s how issues work and why they’re important:

1. Issues are Tasks: They represent things that need to be done or worked on. For example, if we want to add a new puzzle to the game, we’ll create an issue for it.

2. Assigning Issues: Before you start working on an issue, it's best to be assigned to it. This helps everyone know what’s being worked on and prevents multiple people from duplicating effort.

3. Creating Issues: If you see something that needs attention, you can open a new issue! For example, if you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, create a new issue to track it.

4. Linking Issues to PRs: When you submit a PR, you should link it to the issue it addresses by including the issue number in the PR description (e.g., "Fixes #12"). This way, it’s clear what part of the game the PR is intended to fix or improve.

### How to Create an Issue:
1. Go to the Issues tab in the repository.

2. Click New Issue.

3. Fill out the title and description with as much detail as possible (e.g., steps to reproduce a bug, expected vs actual results, etc.).

4. If you're proposing a new feature or a big change, try to include a rough idea of how it might be implemented, any relevant examples, or images.

5. Submit the issue.

### How to Claim an Issue:
1. Look for issues labeled with "good first issue" or "help wanted".

2. Comment on the issue to say you’d like to work on it. Once you’ve commented, feel free to ask to be assigned to it.

3. Once assigned, you can start working on the feature or bug fix, following the steps outlined in the How to Contribute section.
